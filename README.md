## MarcToNTLD

This program reads a MARC file and produces a CSV sutable for ingesting into other systems
The main feature is the ability to read a 500 field and classify the string for the purpose of classifying whether something is a keyword,
faculty advisor, sponser, or the project type
it is *not* optimized and requires significant refactoring
